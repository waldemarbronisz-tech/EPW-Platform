"""Signal watch list (feat/signal-watch) — project.settings["watched_signals"],
a list of {"kind", "signal_id"} entries an engineer pins for continuous
monitoring during simulation, independent of canvas selection. Pure logic,
no Qt dependency — see ui/panels/watch.py for the panel built on top of this,
the same split as core/crossref.py vs. ui/panels/signals.py.

`kind` reuses core/crossref.py's KIND_* constants for consistency with the
Signals panel's own classification of the same four signal namespaces
(ARCHITECTURE.md §10/§14) — but a watch entry's `signal_id` is always the
same identifier an engineer would type/pick for that kind elsewhere in the
app: a physical/analog address for KIND_PHYSICAL_DI/_DO/KIND_ANALOG_IN/_OUT,
the bare internal-signal NAME (not the derived M./MR./MW./MWR.<name> id) for
KIND_INTERNAL_BIT/_REG — exactly what SignalPickerDialog returns and what a
block's own "Bit" property stores — and the catalog id for KIND_SYSTEM.
Keeping the bare name (not the derived id) for internal signals means a
watch survives a retentive-flag or type change to that registry entry; only
a rename or deletion invalidates it, exactly like a block's own "Bit"
property would be affected by the same edit.
