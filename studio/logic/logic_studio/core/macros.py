"""User-defined macro blocks (feat/macro-blocks) — group a subgraph of
existing blocks into a single, named, reusable block type. Pure logic, no
Qt dependency — see ui/canvas/scene.py::create_macro_from_selection() for
the canvas-side action built on top of this.

**Definition model**: `project.settings["macro_definitions"]`, a dict
`def_id -> definition`, where `definition` is:
    {"name": str,
     "blocks": [...serialize()'d internal blocks, INTERNAL connections
                only — a connection from one internal block to another
                is kept; a connection that used to leave the original
                selection is stripped here and recorded instead as an
                entry in "input_pins"/"output_pins" below...],
     "input_pins":  [{"block_uuid", "pin_name", "data_type", "label"}, ...],
     "output_pins": [{"block_uuid", "pin_name", "data_type", "label"}, ...]}
`input_pins`/`output_pins` are ordered — index i is the macro INSTANCE's
own i-th input/output pin, and identifies exactly which internal block's
pin it stands in front of. `def_id` is a short, stable, machine-generated
id (never the display `name`, which the engineer is free to rename) —
every INSTANCE's `type_id` is `"macro.<def_id>"` (core/short_id.py-style
"letter+number" ids are for the per-project BLOCK counter, a different,
unrelated id space; see MACRO_TYPE_PREFIX below).

**Why macro instances can't be a normal BlockRegistry entry**: every other
block type is a single Python class with a FIXED pin layout, registered
once at import time (BlockRegistry.register() even instantiates a
throwaway `dummy = block_class()` — a real, enforced no-arg-constructor
requirement). A macro's pin layout is inherently PROJECT DATA (however
many inputs/outputs THIS macro's THIS definition declares) — there is no
single Python class whose fixed constructor could represent every
possible macro a project might define. `MacroInstanceBlock`
(blocks/macro_instance.py) is instead a single class whose pins are built
by a separate `configure(definition)` call, and Project.deserialize()/
ui/canvas/scene.py resolve its class directly via the "macro." type_id
prefix instead of going through BlockRegistry at all.

**Compiler integration**: expand_project() below produces a fully
FLATTENED block list — every macro instance recursively replaced by a
fresh, independently-uuid'd copy of its definition's own internal blocks,
wired directly to whatever the instance's own external connections were.
compiler/core.py's Compiler.compile() runs Validator/GraphBuilder/
Exporter against this expanded form instead of the live project, so NONE
of the existing compiler stages need to know macros exist at all — the
same reasoning that keeps ExecutionEngine/IOProvider hardware-agnostic
(ARCHITECTURE.md §1) applies here: macros are an authoring-time
convenience, never a runtime concept. EPW_RUNTIME_LOGIC accordingly never
contains a macro reference, only the blocks it expanded to.

**Instance parameters (fix/safety-and-macro-params §C)**: a definition
also carries `"parameters"` and `"parameter_bindings"` —

    "parameters": [{"name", "display_name", "type", "default", "unit",
                     "description", "enum_values"}, ...],
    "parameter_bindings": [{"parameter", "block_uuid", "property_name"}, ...]

`"name"` is a STABLE, internally-generated identifier ("PARAM_1", ...),
never shown to the engineer and never renamed — `parameter_bindings`
reference a parameter by this field so a rename never breaks a binding.
`"display_name"` is what the engineer sees and edits, and (§C1.3) is ALSO
the property key `MacroInstanceBlock` exposes for that parameter — so
renaming a parameter's display_name changes an INSTANCE's own property
key too. This is deliberately the SAME "a rename is indistinguishable
from remove-then-add" trade-off `_resync_pin_list()` above already makes
for boundary pins (see its own docstring) — accepted here for the same
reason: a dedicated, persistent identity kept separate from the
user-facing label isn't worth the schema complexity for how rarely a
parameter is renamed after instances already depend on it.

A tuple `(new_definition, new_bundle)` value — a symbol like
`"${T_ZWLOKA}"` substituted textually into a property's raw string — was
considered and REJECTED in favor of the explicit `parameter_bindings`
table above: text substitution needs its own parser, turns a typed
numeric property into a string the moment a placeholder appears in it
(breaking every existing type-inference/range-validation path a property
already has), and a value that happens to legitimately contain `{`/`}`
becomes a landmine. An explicit binding table is unambiguous, keeps every
property's own type, and is trivially listable/editable from a UI
(§C2.4) without ever touching a property's stored text.

Values live on the INSTANCE, not the definition: `MacroInstanceBlock`
gets one property per parameter (§C1.3, `sync_instance_parameters()`
below) — `expand_project()`'s substitution step (§C3) copies each
instance's OWN value onto its expanded internal blocks' properties,
AFTER those blocks are copied and BEFORE the graph is built, so the rest
of the compiler pipeline sees nothing but ordinary, already-resolved
property values — EPW_RUNTIME_LOGIC needs no changes at all (§C3.3):
after expansion there is no way to tell a property's value came from a
macro parameter rather than being typed in directly.

    Returns a list of ready-to-show warning strings, one per parameter
    value an instance had reset to its default because a parameter's type
    changed underneath it (fix/safety-and-macro-params §C1.4) — shown by
    the caller RIGHT AWAY rather than deferred to the next compile like
    analog.quality's own migration notice (core/project.py): a macro
    instance is never itself a block Validator's compile-time view sees
    (expand_project() replaces it with its definition's own internal
    blocks before Validator ever runs, §C3.3), and a `simulation_state`
    notice living on it would in general be silently dropped the moment
    ANY breadcrumb level involved is next committed by
    update_definition_blocks() (serialize() never persists
    `simulation_state` — by design, see base.py's own field tuples) long
    before a compile ever happens. Surfacing the message here instead —
    at the one moment this function already knows exactly which
    instances were actually affected — is the reliable equivalent, not a
    lesser one.

    Two kinds of instance, handled differently:

    - LIVE ones — real Python objects, found by scanning
      `live_block_lists`: every block list that's CURRENTLY live Python
      objects, not just settings data. That's `project.blocks` itself
      PLUS every ancestor level's own stashed list if the caller is mid
      breadcrumb-navigation (MainWindow's own `_macro_nav_stack` entries
      — this module has no notion of a "nav stack" itself, so the caller
      assembles the list). A sibling level NOT on the current breadcrumb
      path (a different macro's own edit view, never entered this
      session) has no live objects at all — see the next case.
    - Instances embedded in some OTHER definition's own stored `"blocks"`
      (project.settings) are rewritten directly as dicts instead — they
      aren't live objects right now regardless of nav state.

    `def_id`'s OWN "blocks" are deliberately never scanned here — a
    macro can't contain a live instance of itself (compile-time cycle
    detection, core/macros.py::expand_project()) in any project this
    module itself ever produced; a hand-edited file that smuggled one in
    anyway is exactly the "cycle" `expand_project()` already catches and
    refuses to compile, not something this function needs to guard
    against on its own."""

    - `definition`: the dict shape documented at module level, ready for

    - `crossings`: one entry per pin that had a connection LEAVING the
      selection — `{"direction", "instance_pin_index", "external_pin_uuid"}`

      block's own boundary pin at that index to the recorded external pin,
      once the instance actually exists and the extracted blocks have been
      removed.

    A connection between two blocks BOTH inside the selection is an
    internal connection (kept in `definition["blocks"]` verbatim, never a
    crossing). An INPUT pin can have at most one external connection (the
    single-driver rule, Pin.connect()); an OUTPUT pin can fan out to
    several external readers — that becomes ONE exposed output pin with

    several separate output pins for what is, internally, one signal.

    concept to attach to and is simply left out — same as ui/canvas/
    scene.py's own create_macro_from_selection() already did for every
    Wire touching an extracted block before this, just now conditional
    on whether it's actually capturable instead of unconditional.

    Deliberately re-derives the same "keep only connections landing inside
    the selection" filtering ui/canvas/scene.py's own
