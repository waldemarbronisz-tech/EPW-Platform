"""Canvas navigation helpers — "jump to and briefly pulse-highlight a
block" — factored out of SignalsPanel (feat/signal-crossref §3.1) so a
SECOND caller (BlockItem's own context menu, for jumping directly between
blocks that share the same signal reference) doesn't have to duplicate it.
Free functions, not tied to any particular widget: all they need is the

    fix/qtimer-lifetime: this used to build a bare, ownerless QTimer()
    kept alive only by a Python attribute stashed on `overlay`, guarded
    by a try/except RuntimeError around the callback. That caught the
    common case (Qt raising cleanly on a stale wrapper) but not the one
    that actually took CI down: Qt is not guaranteed to raise a
    catchable exception when a timer this stale touches a destroyed
    QGraphicsItem — it can abort the process instead, which no
    try/except can intercept. create_owned_timer() fixes this at the
    root: `scene` is a real QObject, so it owns the timer outright
    (destroyed automatically along with the scene), and `overlay` — a
    QGraphicsItem, not a QObject, so it can never be a Qt parent — is
    instead checked with shiboken6.isValid() before every tick via
    `guard`, covering the scene.clear() case (item gone, scene very
