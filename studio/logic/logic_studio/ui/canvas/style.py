# Port/body geometry (feat/editor-modes-and-geometry §1 — supersedes the
# earlier "denser pin-pitch grid" fix from feat/block-rendering-library,
# which made multi-input gates less flattened but never fully square: a
# 4-input gate was still 40x80, its D-shape curve stretched over that full
# 80px height. This redesign fixes the ROOT cause instead: the gate BODY is
# now a fixed GATE_BODY x GATE_BODY square, period, regardless of input
# count — the D-shape/shield curve is therefore always drawn at the exact
# same proportions. Inputs beyond what fits inside that fixed body spread
# out symmetrically above/below it and are collected by a vertical "rail"
# entering the body's own left edge (§1.3) — the standard multi-input-gate
# convention in protection/relay schematics (e²TANGO-Studio among them).
#
# Two independent constants now, not one two-tier system:
#   - GRID_SNAP (10) is the block-PLACEMENT grid — block origins snap to it
#     (drag-and-drop, snap-on-move), and it's the finer of the two
#     background dot spacings (GRID_MINOR below).
#   - PORT_PITCH (20) is the spacing between a gate's/COMPLEX block's own
#     consecutive ports, and GATE_BODY (40) is the gate body's fixed size —
#     both independent of GRID_SNAP; a port position is `PORT_PITCH * k`
#     from the block's own center, and since PORT_PITCH is a GRID_SNAP
#     multiple, every port still lands on the placement grid in scene
#     coordinates once a grid-aligned block origin is added — same
#     invariant as before, just no longer requiring the same NUMBER for
#     both purposes.
