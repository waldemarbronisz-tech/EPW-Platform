    and — when `draw_leads` is true — a short straight "lead" line on every
    pin between its port square and the body, matching the reference IEC/
    ANSI symbol style instead of the body touching the port squares
    directly. `draw_leads` defaults to true for the canvas; icons.py passes
    false to keep small tree/preview icons from being eaten alive by lead
    lines that make no sense at 24px.

    feat/editor-modes-and-geometry §1: the drawn BODY is always exactly
    GATE_BODY x GATE_BODY, vertically centered within `rect` — never
    stretched taller for more inputs the way it used to be (that stretching
    is exactly what made the D-shape/shield curve look "flattened" for
    anything past 2-3 inputs, since the curve's own proportions followed
    the body's full height). Inputs beyond what fits inside that fixed
    body (`|offset| > GATE_BODY/2`, i.e. 4 or more) spread out
    symmetrically above/below it — see centered_port_offsets() — and are
    collected by a vertical "rail" at the same x the body's own (lead-
    pulled-back) left edge sits at, so the rail visually continues straight
    into the body rather than sitting merely adjacent to it. For
    `draw_leads=False` (icons), there's no separate "body vs. block"
    distinction — the body just fills whatever (small, fixed-size) rect the
    icon was given, as before this section.

    The rect's right edge (x0 + w) is always the gate's actual output
    connection point (where PortItem sits), negated or not, and its left
    edge (x0) is where every input PortItem sits — pulled back from both by
    GATE_LEAD (plus, for a negated gate's output side, the negation bubble
    and its own clearance from the port — see BUBBLE_PORT_GAP) with lead
    lines filling the resulting gaps. This keeps every port's own position
    completely unchanged (still exactly at 0 / width, still grid-aligned).

    The D-shape (AND/NAND) right-side curve is a true ELLIPSE, not a fixed-
    radius semicircle — sized to the always-fixed GATE_BODY now, so it's
    never anything but the same clean curve regardless of input count.
