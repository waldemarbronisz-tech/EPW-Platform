defined macro. See core/macros.py's module docstring for why this can't be
a normal BlockRegistry entry: its pin layout is project data (however many

Python class constructor could represent. Never registered via
@BlockRegistry.register — core/project.py's deserialize() and
ui/canvas/scene.py resolve this class directly via the "macro." type_id
