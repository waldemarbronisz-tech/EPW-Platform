    # feat/wire-modes-and-labels §0.1: the same structural fix as Pin's
    # SERIALIZED_FIELDS, applied here because serialize()/deserialize()
    # already had the identical fragile shape — a hand-written dict literal
    # on one side, a hand-written set of assignments on the other, free to
    # silently drift apart.
    #
    # Only the flat, directly-comparable fields live in this list — not
    # every serialize() key. `type_id`/`category`/`description` are
    # deliberately excluded: they're determined by the block's own CLASS
    # (cls() already sets them correctly), and restoring them from a file
    # would risk overwriting current code's definition with stale data
    # instead of catching a mismatch. `position`/`size`/`properties`/
    # `inputs`/`outputs` are structured, not flat scalars, and keep their
    # own explicit handling in deserialize().
    #
    # feat/io-labels-and-ids §5.6 dead-property audit removed `visibility`
    # and `execution_state` from here (and from __init__ entirely — see
    # that section's report): neither was ever read by anything but the
    # property grid's own display and this class's serialize()/
    # deserialize(), so keeping them was exactly the "UI element showing a
    # value nothing depends on" problem this project consistently cuts.
    # `enabled` stays: validate() (below) genuinely branches on it, even
    # though — also noted in that audit — nothing currently WRITES it
    # False, so that branch is presently unreachable in practice pending a
    # real UI toggle.
    #
    # §4.1/§4.2: `short_id` (a project-unique, human-readable "g12"-style
    # id, replacing the UUID in every user-facing message) is assigned
    # exactly once, by Project.add_block() — never here, and never
    # copied by clone() below — so a pasted/duplicated block always gets a
    # fresh one instead of colliding with its source (core/short_id.py).

    # of bug it exists to prevent (a field silently never restored on load)
    # has now bitten three times: Pin.connections (aliased, not copied),
    # Pin.disabled (dropped outright), and BaseLogicBlock.visibility/
    # execution_state (serialized but never read back — found and removed
    # in feat/io-labels-and-ids §5.6, the same PR that introduced this
    # class's own SERIALIZED_FIELDS). The audit test itself never followed
    # it here. These two tuples are what closes that gap: every plain
    # attribute a fresh block carries must appear in exactly one of
    # SERIALIZED_FIELDS (round-tripped generically), _STRUCTURED_FIELDS
    # (also persisted, but via its own explicit code in serialize()/
    # deserialize() below — type_id/category/description are class-
    # determined and never restored from a file, position/size/inputs/
    # outputs/properties are nested structures, not flat scalars), or
    # _TRANSIENT_FIELDS (never serialized at all, deliberately). A field
    # added to __init__ without being classified into one of these three
    # fails test_every_serializable_block_attribute_is_accounted_for()
