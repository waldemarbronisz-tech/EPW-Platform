"""feat/block-rendering-library §4 — "the most important section of this
PR": every connection point (port), on every registered block type, must
land on a grid intersection in the block's own local coordinates (and
therefore, combined with a grid-aligned block origin, in scene coordinates
too). This is the single most important test in the PR (§4.7/§12.5).

feat/editor-modes-and-geometry §1 superseded the previous "denser pin-pitch
grid" design entirely: GRID_SNAP (10) is the block-placement grid AND the
true finest deterministic unit every port position is built from; PORT_PITCH
(20, a GRID_SNAP multiple) is the spacing between a block's own consecutive
ports, symmetric around its vertical center — no longer anchored from the
top edge. Checked here against GRID_SNAP, not PORT_PITCH — a port can land
on an odd multiple of GRID_SNAP that isn't itself a PORT_PITCH multiple
(e.g. input.ai's two outputs, at center ± PORT_PITCH/2)."""
